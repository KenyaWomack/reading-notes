# Event Driven Applications

## What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

 the 'events' module. This module provides the necessary functionality to create and handle custom events within a Node.js application.

 ## What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

 Modularity and Reusability, Encapsulation and Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism

 ## Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

  you have a website where users can interact with various features, such as submitting forms, clicking buttons, or sending messages. When a user performs any of these actions, the website needs to respond and handle those events accordingly. This is where Event Driven Programming (EDP) comes into play.

In the context of a web application's backend, Node.js enables developers to use EDP to build efficient and responsive systems. Here's how I would explain it to a non-technical friend:

In the backend of a web application, Node.js acts as a server, handling requests and responses between the user's browser and the database. One of the key advantages of using Node.js is its ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections without slowing down.
