# Express, NPM, TDD

## Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter

n the context of web development, middleware is like a bridge that connects the web server and the web application. It plays a crucial role in processing and handling incoming requests from users and generating appropriate responses. It's like a traffic cop that directs and manages the flow of data and requests within the application.

## Express the most popular __ __ __

open-source web application framework

## Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

Express does not enforce any specific conventions or impose strict guidelines on how you should structure your web application. It gives developers the freedom and flexibility to make their own choices regarding the architecture, organization, and components of their application.

## What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

Code organization, Reusability,Encapsulation and abstraction, Collaboration, and Testing and maintenance

## What version of npm are you running on your machine?

9.6.4

## What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

npm install jshint

## Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

They help ensure the reliability and quality of software applications. 

## What are three expected benefits of testing

Increased Software Reliability, Cost Savings, and Increased Confidence and Customer Satisfaction

## Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

Lack of Test Coverage and Testing Implementation Details

Lack of Collaboration and Testing as an Afterthought

## What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

Early Bug Detection, Faster Feedback Loop, and Improved Collaboration and Code Integration

## What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

Continuous Delivery (CD): CD is a software development approach where changes are continuously integrated, tested, and prepared for release. Continuous Deployment (CD): CD takes the automation further by automatically deploying the software to production as soon as it passes the necessary tests and quality checks. 

## Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

 It allows developers to store and manage their source code repositories in a centralized location. GitHub provides version control functionality, allowing developers to track and manage changes to the codebase over time.GitHub facilitates collaboration through pull requests. GitHub integrates with various CI/CD tools and services.
