# Hash Tables

Imagine you have a library with thousands of books, and you want to be able to quickly find a specific book when someone gives you its title. Instead of searching through each book one by one, you have a catalog that stores the title of each book along with its corresponding shelf location.

In this analogy, the library catalog represents the hash table. The titles of the books are the keys, and the shelf locations are the values. When you want to find a book, you can simply look up its title in the catalog, which will give you the corresponding shelf location. This allows you to directly go to the correct shelf and retrieve the book without having to search through the entire library.

Similarly, in a hash table, you have a set of keys and their associated values. The hash function is like the catalog lookup process. It takes a key as input and maps it to a specific index in the underlying array. This index serves as the location where the value associated with the key is stored. By using a hash table, you can efficiently retrieve values by their keys without having to search through all the elements in the data structure.
