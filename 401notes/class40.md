# Ethics in Tech

## "The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of"

The article emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in software development, particularly as technology becomes increasingly integrated into various aspects of our lives. It serves as a reminder that as developers, we have a responsibility to think critically about the effects of our code and consider the potential risks and ethical implications it may have on users. The article highlights the need for developers to be aware of the impact their work can have on individuals and society. It calls for a conscious effort to ensure that ethics are a fundamental aspect of code development, emphasizing the importance of considering the potential consequences of the software we create.

I believe that we, as coders, have to have a moral compass and that we need to take our roles very seriously when it comes to our integrity.

## "Self Driving Car Ethics"

his article discusses the ethical considerations and challenges related to self-driving cars. It addresses the question of how self-driving cars should make decisions in no-win situations where there is a potential for harm to individuals. These scenarios, often referred to as the "trolley problem," involve situations where the car must make a choice between two undesirable outcomes. The article explores different perspectives on how self-driving cars should be programmed to handle such situations. The article also highlights the potential societal impact of self-driving cars, including their ability to reduce traffic accidents and fatalities. It acknowledges that while self-driving cars have the potential to save lives, there are concerns and fears among the public regarding the ethical decisions made by these vehicles. 

I can see both sides of the coin in this article. I do believe self driving cars are the way of the future but there needs to be some type of mechanism to ensure that the drivers are paying attention.
