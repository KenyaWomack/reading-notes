## What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model used to manage and control access to resources in a system or application. It is based on the concept of assigning roles to users and granting permissions based on those roles. In RBAC, permissions are not directly assigned to individual users, but rather to predefined roles, and users are assigned one or more roles.
