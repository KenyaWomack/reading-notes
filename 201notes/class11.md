## Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

The early 2000s: At this time, web-based video and audio were limited to low-quality, low-resolution formats like RealPlayer, QuickTime, and Windows Media Player. These formats required users to download and install specific software and plugins to access the content, and there were compatibility issues across different operating systems and web browsers. Late 2010s to present day: Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu have become dominant players in the video and audio landscape, offering high-quality, on-demand content that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. Live streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Live have also become increasingly popular, enabling users to broadcast and share live video and audio content in real-time.
