## Explain why we need domain modeling.

Domain modeling is a great tool for Agile enterprise to carry out a common language and a fundamental structure important for the analysis of features and epics. The domain model is defined and continuously refactored as enterprise knowledge about the domain improves and the system functionality evolves.

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

A constructor is a special member method which will be called by the JVM implicitly (automatically) for placing user/programmer defined values instead of placing default values. Constructors are meant for initializing the object.

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script.
