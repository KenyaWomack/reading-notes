# Debugging

## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A syntax error occurs when we make a mistake in our coding, such as forgetting a semicolon to indicate the end of a statement. A logic error is harder to find. This occurs when we have all the correct syntax but we coded a portion of the program with an error, such as maybe, divide by zero.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Mostly syntax errors and I am able to correct by debugging.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

By continuing to help me get better with coding.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

forcing errors to be reported to the user. With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints, and examine variables while the code is executing.

## Define what a breakpoint is.

places where code execution can be stopped

## What is the call stack?

a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program
