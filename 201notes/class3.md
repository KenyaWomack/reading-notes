## When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

An unordered list ( <ul> ) is used to create a list of items in no particular order i.e. the order of items is not relevant. By default, the items in this list will be marked with bullets. Whereas, an ordered list ( <ol> ) is used to create a list of items in a specific order.

## Learn JS

## What data types can you store inside of an Array?

They can store numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), characters, objects, and so on. But once you define the type of values that your array will store, all its elements must be of that same type.

## Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

No, because there are numbers and not just names in the line of code.

## List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

Declaring Variables Shorthand
It’s good practice to declare your variable assignments at the beginning of your functions. This shorthand method can save you lots of time and space when declaring multiple variables at the same time.

Short-circuit Evaluation Shorthand
When assigning a variable value to another variable, you may want to ensure that the source variable is not null, undefined, or empty. You can either write a long if statement with multiple conditionals, or use a short-circuit evaluation

The Ternary Operator
This is a great code saver when you want to write an if..else statement in just one line

If Presence Shorthand
This might be trivial, but worth a mention. When doing “if checks”, assignment operators can sometimes be omitted.

JavaScript For Loop Shorthand
This little tip is really useful if you want plain JavaScript and don’t want to rely on external libraries such as jQuery or lodash.

## Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

False. I have no idea.

## Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

If I am going 67 in a 65, I am speeding.

## Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

If I am typing in the wrong password in my bank account, I will keep getting asked or get locked out of my account.
