# Creating Hyperlinks

Learning to code.

## To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?

A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

## What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?

Use concise and meaningful text for links.
Do not capitalize all letters in links.
Avoid using URLs for link text.
Do not use the word "link" as part of the link text.
Do not use tooltips/screentips to add additional information.

## CSS Layout

## What is meant by “normal flow”?

the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

## What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and the element grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. You can't set width or height on inline elements — they just sit inside the content of block level elements — except for images.

## ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

## Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on.

## What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.

## Learn JS 

## Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).

## What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter.
