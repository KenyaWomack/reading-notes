## When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

A fairly common element you'll meet when looking around the Web is <abbr> â€” this is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym. When including either, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means.

# Learn CSS

## What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document.
An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a <style> element contained inside the HTML <head>.
Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute.

## Why should we avoid using inline styles?

It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.
