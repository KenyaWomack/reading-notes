 It helps clients and servers speak to me

 The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any <link>-element references to external CSS stylesheets and any <script>-element references to scripts.

 As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from <link> elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from <script> elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.

 The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.

 As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.

 let myVariable = 'Bob'; or
let myVariable = "Bob";
This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.

let myVariable = 10;
This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.

Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable.

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

The anatomy of our element is:

The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.
The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

<article> Tag: This tag contains independent content that doesn’t require any other context. So the <article> tag can be placed inside the main content. But each of the articles will contain independent content within it. 

<section> Tag: This tag is used to split a page into sections like Introduction, Contact Information, Details, etc and each of these sections can be in a different <section> tag. The <section> tag is introduced to wrap-up the things in a particular section. The <section> tag divides the content into sections and subsections. The section tag is used when requirements of two headers or footers or any other section of documents needed. Section tag grouped the generic block of related content. 

Websites typically include a header, navigation bar, main content, a sidebar, and a footer.

Specifying a description that includes keywords relating to the content of your page is useful as it has the potential to make your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines (such activities are termed Search Engine Optimization, or SEO.)

<meta charset="utf-8" />
This element specifies the document's character encoding — the character set that the document is permitted to use. utf-8 is a universal character set that includes pretty much any character from any human language.

So when you get an idea and want to turn it into a website, there are a few questions you should answer before anything else:

What exactly do I want to accomplish?
How will a website help me reach my goals?
What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?
All of this is called project ideation and is a necessary first step to reach your goal, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer.

The most important question to answer is "Whst exactly do I want to accomplish?"

The h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
<span> will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

Scrolling through a webpage and interacting with the touch screen on a phone both require JavaScript.

JavaScript only needs the <script> element
