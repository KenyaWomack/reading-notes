How the Web Works

Computers connected to the internet are clients and servers
Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices ( ie. computer connected to wifi or phone connected to mobile network)
Servers store web pages, sites, or apps. 
When a client wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is doenloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed on user's web browser
