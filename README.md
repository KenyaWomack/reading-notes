## My reading journal for Code Fellows

###### **My name is Kenya and I am excited about learning JavaScript!!!**

Growth mindset to me means that I should always stay focused on the bigger picture and to not get so discouraged that I lose sight of my goal.

Reminders to myself to stay in a growth mindset are:
- *Never stop learning*
- *Never give up*
- *Remember my 'Why"*
