## Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Fielding is a computer scientist and one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the architectural principles that underpin the World Wide Web.

## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

techniques taught in a typical computer networking class are designed to work well within a controlled network environment, where the number of devices and the amount of traffic are relatively small and predictable. However, the internet is a global network with millions of connected devices, each with its own unique characteristics, and the amount of traffic is constantly changing and increasing.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

a protocol for exchanging information between a web server and a web client (such as a web browser)

## What does a GET do?

to retrieve a resource from a server

## What does a POST do?

used by a client (such as a web browser) to submit data to a server for processing or storage

## What does PUT do?

to update or replace an existing resource on a server

## What does PATCH do?

to partially modify an existing resource on a server
