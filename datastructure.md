# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

Time complexity, Space complexity, Data ordering and sorting, and Data access and modification patterns

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Define a base case, Ensure progress towards the base case, Check for stopping conditions, and Use tail recursion or iteration
